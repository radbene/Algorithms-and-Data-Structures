Given an n-element array of natural numbers T and positive natural numbers k and p, where
k ≤ p ≤ n. Let z[i] be the k-th largest of the elements: T[i], T[i+1], ..., T[i+p-1].
In other words, z[i] is the k-th largest element in T in the index interval from i to i + p - 1 inclusive.
To clarify: Consider the array [17,25,25,30]. In this array, the 1st largest element
is 30, the 2nd largest element is 25, the 3rd largest element is also 25 (second occurrence), and the
4th largest element is 17.
Please implement the function ksum(T, k, p), which for an array T (of size n) and
positive natural numbers k and p (k ≤ p ≤ n) it calculates and returns the value of the sum:
z[0] + z[1] + z[2] + . . . + z[n-p]
Example. For input:
T = [7,9,1,5,8,6,2,12]
k = 4
p = 5
calling ksum(T, k, p) should return the value 17 (corresponding to the sum of 5 + 5 + 2 + 5).
